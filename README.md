# SFML
This is an attempt to build game engine from scratch with ECS system.
This branch is assignment 2 from "COMP4300 - C++ Game Programming by Dave Churchill"

Description:
A lightweight 2D game engine prototype built using SFML and structured around the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture. Designed for clarity and efficiency, it avoids bloated inheritance hierarchies in favor of modular, data-driven design—ideal for learning core engine development concepts without unnecessary complexity.

Though currently on hold, this project provided valuable insight into game engine architecture, low-level C++ systems, and the challenges of optimization. The decision to pause development wasn’t technical but practical: dorm life—where "shared space" means coding to the soothing soundtrack of roommates’ TikTok marathons—isn’t exactly ideal for deep engine work. Once conditions improve (read: actual quiet and workspace), I plan to revisit this with a stronger focus on graphics and performance.
